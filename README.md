When i say: 

  -uncut, are samples with length of 300
  
  -cut, samples with the same randomized length between 50 and 200  
  
  -random, that every sample has their own length 

To get your dataset:

  1.download the initial_dataset.zip file and exstract it. I had it on my drive so just change it to your destination in the code(it will be noted where)
  
  2.download the colab code
  
To use the code follow the following procedure:

  1.You dont need what is under the tab "Getting traces" but it is there just in case if you couldnt get the initial_dataset from my github.
  
  2.Run the full "My definitions" tab.
  
  3.In the "Setting START, STOP, LENGTH ..." tab choose which method (uncut/cut/random) you are going to use.
  
  4.In the same tab you have the code to upload the initial_dataset, just choose the right path on your computer (I used my drive).
  
  5.In the "Getting your dataset" tab again choose the method you picked before. Run both lines of code to get dataset and upload that dataset.
